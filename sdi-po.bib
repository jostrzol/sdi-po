  abstract = {This paper presents BoardGameDescription (BGD), a Do-
              main Specific Language (DSL) to describe board games
              and record and replay matches1. A wide variety of board
              game genres and types can be modelled in BGD, resulting
              in a general board game DSL to both describe and play
              board games.},
